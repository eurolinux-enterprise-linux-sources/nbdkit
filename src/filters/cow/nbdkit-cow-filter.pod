=head1 NAME

nbdkit-cow-filter - nbdkit copy-on-write (COW) filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=cow plugin [plugin-args...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-cow-filter> is a filter that makes a temporary writable copy
on top of a read-only plugin.  It can be used to enable writes for
plugins which only implement read-only access.  Note that:

=over 4

=item *

B<Anything written is thrown away as soon as nbdkit exits.>

=item *

All connections to the nbdkit instance see the same view of the disk.

This is different from L<nbd-server(1)> where each connection sees its
own copy-on-write overlay and simply disconnecting the client throws
that away.  It also allows us to create diffs, see below.

=item *

The plugin is opened read-only (as if the I<-r> flag was passed), but
you should B<not> pass the I<-r> flag to nbdkit.

=back

Limitations of the filter include:

=over 4

=item *

The underlying file/device must not be resized.

=item *

The underlying plugin must behave “normally”, meaning that it must
serve the same data to each client.

=back

=head1 PARAMETERS

There are no parameters specific to nbdkit-cow-filter.  Any parameters
are passed through to and processed by the underlying plugin in the
normal way.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Serve the file F<disk.img>, allowing writes, but do not save any
changes into the file:

 nbdkit --filter=cow file file=disk.img

L<nbdkit-xz-plugin(1)> only supports read access, but you can provide
temporary write access by doing (although this does B<not> save
changes to the file):

 nbdkit --filter=cow xz file=disk.xz

=head1 CREATING A DIFF WITH QEMU-IMG

Although nbdkit-cow-filter itself cannot save the differences, it is
possible to do this using an obscure feature of L<qemu-img(1)>.
B<nbdkit must remain continuously running during the whole operation,
otherwise all changes will be lost>.

Run nbdkit:

 nbdkit --filter=cow file file=disk.img

and then connect with a client and make whatever changes you need.
At the end, disconnect the client.

Run these C<qemu-img> commands to construct a qcow2 file containing
the differences:

 qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b nbd:localhost diff.qcow2
 qemu-img rebase -b disk.img diff.qcow2

F<diff.qcow2> now contains the differences between the base
(F<disk.img>) and the changes stored in nbdkit-cow-filter.  C<nbdkit>
can now be killed.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item C<TMPDIR>

The copy-on-write changes are stored in a temporary file located in
C</var/tmp> by default.  You can override this location by setting the
C<TMPDIR> environment variable before starting nbdkit.
