=head1 NAME

nbdkit-log-filter - nbdkit log filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=log plugin logfile=FILE [logappend=BOOL] [plugin-args...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-log-filter> is a filter that logs all transactions.  When
used as the first filter, it can show the original client requests; as
a later filter, it can show how earlier filters have modified the
original request.  The log results are placed in a user-specified
file; for more details on the log format, see L<FILES>.  Note that
using C<nbdkit -v -f> produces much more verbose logging details to
stderr about every aspect of nbdkit operation, although this requires
running nbdkit in the foreground; while the log filter is designed to
work even when nbdkit is run as a daemon.

=head1 PARAMETERS

The nbdkit-log-filter requires a single parameter C<logfile> which
specifies the path of the file to use for logging.  If the file
already exists, it will be truncated unless the C<logappend> parameter
was specified with a value that can be parsed as a boolean true.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Serve the file F<disk.img>, and log each client transaction in the
file F<disk.log>:

 nbdkit --filter=log file disk.img logfile=disk.log

Repeat the task, but with the cow (copy-on-write) filter to perform
local caching of data served from the original plugin:

 nbdkit --filter=cow --filter=log file disk.img logfile=disk.log2

After running a client that performs the same operations under each of
the two servers, you can compare F<disk.log> and F<disk.log2> to see
the impact of the caching.

=head1 FILES

This filter writes to the file specified by the C<logfile=FILE>
parameter.  All lines include a timestamp, a connection counter, then
details about the command.  The following actions are logged: Connect,
Read, Write, Zero, Trim, Flush, and Disconnect.  Except for Connect
and Disconnect, an event is logged across two lines for call and
return value, to allow tracking duration and tracing any parallel
execution, using id for correlation (incremented per action on the
connection).

An example logging session of a client that performs a single
successful read is:

 2018-01-27 20:38:22.959984 connection=1 Connect size=0x400 write=1 flush=1 rotational=0 trim=0 zero=1 fua=1
 2018-01-27 20:38:23.001720 connection=1 Read id=1 offset=0x0 count=0x100 ...
 2018-01-27 20:38:23.001995 connection=1 ...Read id=1 return=0 (Success)
 2018-01-27 20:38:23.044259 connection=1 Disconnect transactions=1
