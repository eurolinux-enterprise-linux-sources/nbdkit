=head1 NAME

nbdkit-offset-filter - nbdkit offset filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=offset plugin offset=OFFSET range=LENGTH [plugin-args...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-offset-filter> is a filter that limits requests to the byte
range C<[offset .. offset+range-1]> within another plugin.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<offset=OFFSET>

The start offset.  The offset must be E<ge> 0.

This parameter is optional.  If not given then C<offset=0> is assumed.

=item B<range=LENGTH>

The length of data to serve.

This parameter is optional.  If not given then the range is served
starting from the offset through to the end of the underlying
file/device.

=back

Note it is an error if the offset and/or range specify data which lies
beyond the end of the underlying device.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Serve part of a file

Using L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)>, serve the file C<disk.img> starting at
offset C<1M>.  The total length served is C<100M> (the underlying file
must therefore be at least C<101M> in length):

 nbdkit --filter=offset file file=disk.img offset=1M range=100M

=head2 Serve a single partition

I<An easier way to do this is with L<nbdkit-partition-filter(1)>.>

One way to serve a single partition from a disk is to find the start
and length of the partition, eg using:

 $ parted disk.img -- unit b print
 ...
 Number  Start   End         Size        Type     File system  Flags
  1      65536B  104792575B  104727040B  primary  ext2

You can then serve the partition only using:

 nbdkit --filter=offset file file=disk.img offset=65536 range=104727040
