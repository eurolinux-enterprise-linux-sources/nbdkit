=head1 NAME

nbdkit-nozero-filter - nbdkit nozero filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=nozero plugin [zeromode=MODE] [plugin-args...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-nozero-filter> is a filter that intentionally disables
efficient handling of sparse file holes (ranges of all-zero bytes)
across the NBD protocol.  It is mainly useful for evaluating timing
differences between naive vs. sparse-aware connections, and for
testing client or server fallbacks.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<zeromode=none|emulate>

Optional, controls which mode the filter will use.  Mode B<none>
(default) means that zero support is not advertised to the client;
mode B<emulate> means that zero support is emulated by the filter
using the plugin's C<pwrite> callback, regardless of whether the
plugin itself implemented the C<zero> callback with a more efficient
way to write zeros.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Serve the file F<disk.img>, but force the client to write zeroes
explicitly rather than with C<NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES>:

 nbdkit --filter=nozero file disk.img

Serve the file F<disk.img>, allowing the client to take advantage of
less network traffic via C<NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES>, but still forcing
the data to be written explicitly rather than punching any holes:

 nbdkit --filter=nozero file zeromode=emulate disk.img
