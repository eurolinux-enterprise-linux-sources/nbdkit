The real tests use libguestfs as a convenient way to control the qemu
NBD client.

To test a plugin using libguestfs:

  - #include <test.h>

  - Call:

    test_start_nbdkit ("plugin", <plugin args ...>, NULL)

    at the beginning.  This starts the nbdkit server.

  - Open a libguestfs handle, and configure the NBD client using:

    guestfs_add_drive_opts (g, "",
                            GUESTFS_ADD_DRIVE_OPTS_FORMAT, "raw",
                            GUESTFS_ADD_DRIVE_OPTS_PROTOCOL, "nbd",
                            GUESTFS_ADD_DRIVE_OPTS_SERVER, server,
                            -1);

    'server' is a global that is initialized by 'test_start_nbdkit' and
    points to the nbdkit server socket.

  - Perform tests via libguestfs using the libguestfs device "/dev/sda",
    which corresponds to the NBD drive exposed by the plugin.

  - Close the handle and exit.  An 'atexit' handler installed by
    'test_start_nbdkit' cleans up the server automatically.

For an example, see 'test-file.c'.
