nbdkit-split-plugin - nbdkit plugin to concatenate split files into one disk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit split file=file1 [file=file2 file=file3 ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

files are logically concatenated into a single disk image.

=head2 Differences from nbdkit-file-plugin

Normally to serve a single file you should use
L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)>.  This plugin differs from nbdkit-file-plugin
as follows:

=over 4

=item *

nbdkit-file-plugin is faster and more efficient.  It has a fully
parallel implementation, and does not have to deal with the complexity
of locating the correct file to serve or splitting requests across
files.

=item *

nbdkit-file-plugin allows you to resize the underlying file
dynamically.  The underlying files must B<not> be resized when using
the split plugin.

=item *

nbdkit-file-plugin can handle block devices, but the split plugin can
only handle plain files.

=item *

nbdkit-file-plugin handles writes of blocks of zeroes efficiently, but
the split plugin cannot.

=item *

nbdkit-file-plugin can "punch holes" in the backing file in response
to a trim request from the client, but the split plugin does not
support this.
