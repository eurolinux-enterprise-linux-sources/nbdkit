=head1 NAME

nbdkit-memory-plugin - nbdkit virtual memory plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit memory size=SIZE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-memory-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which stores a
single disk image in virtual memory, and discards it when nbdkit
exits.  This plugin can be used for testing or where you don't care
about the final content of the disk image.

All nbdkit clients will see the same disk content, initially all
zeroes.

The disk image is stored in memory using a sparse array.  The
allocated parts of the disk image cannot be larger than physical RAM
plus swap, less whatever is being used by the rest of the system.  If
you want to allocate more space than this use L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)>
backed by a temporary file instead.

However the virtual size can be as large as you like, up to the
maximum supported by nbdkit (S<2⁶³-1 bytes>).  This limit is tested
when nbdkit is compiled, and it should work on all platforms and
architectures supported by nbdkit.

=head2 Preloading small amounts of data

If you want an in-memory disk image preinitialized with a small amount
of data specified on the command line, look at
L<nbdkit-data-plugin(1)> instead.  Note by "small" this does not mean
that the virtual disk image must be small, but that the amount of data
initially stored sparsely is small enough to specify on the command
line.

=head2 Preloading large amounts of data

If you want to preload a large amount of data (eg. a disk image) into
the memory plugin, use L<qemu-img(1)>:

 $ rm -f pid
 $ nbdkit -P pid memory size=10G
 
 # wait for nbdkit to become ready to accept connections:
 $ while [ ! -f pid ]; do sleep 1; done
 
 # preload Fedora disk image:
 $ virt-builder fedora-28 --size=10G
 $ qemu-img convert -p -n fedora-28.img nbd:localhost:10809

=head1 PARAMETERS
