=head1 NAME

nbdkit-nbd-plugin - nbdkit nbd plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit nbd socket=SOCKNAME [export=NAME]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-nbd-plugin> is an NBD forwarding plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.

It provides an NBD server that forwards all traffic as a client to
another existing NBD server.  A primary usage of this setup is to
alter the set of features available to the ultimate end client,
without having to change the original server (for example, to convert
between oldstyle and newstyle, or to add TLS support where the original
server lacks it).

For now, this is limited to connecting to another NBD server over a
named Unix socket without TLS, although it is feasible that future
additions will support network sockets and encryption.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<socket=>SOCKNAME

Connect to the NBD server located at the Unix socket C<SOCKNAME>.  The
server can speak either new or old style protocol.

This parameter is required.

=item B<export=>NAME

If this parameter is given, and the server speaks new style protocol,
then connect to the named export instead of the default export (the
empty string).
