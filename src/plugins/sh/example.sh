#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Example Bash plugin.
#
# This example can be freely used for any purpose.
#
# Run it from the build directory like this:
#
#   ./nbdkit -f -v sh ./plugins/sh/example.sh file=disk.img
#
# Or run it after installing nbdkit like this:
#
#   nbdkit -f -v sh ./plugins/sh/example.sh file=disk.img
#
# The -f -v arguments are optional.  They cause the server to stay in
# the foreground and print debugging, which is useful when testing.
#
# You can connect to the server using guestfish or qemu, eg:
#
#   guestfish --format=raw -a nbd://localhost
#   ><fs> run
#   ><fs> list-filesystems
#   ><fs> mount /dev/sda1 /

# Note that the exit code of the script matters:
#  0 => OK
#  1 => Error
#  2 => Method is missing
#  3 => False
# For other values, see the nbdkit-sh-plugin(3) manual page.

# Check we're being run from nbdkit.
#
# Because the script has to be executable (for nbdkit to run it) there
# is a danger that someone could run the script standalone which won't
# work.  Use two tests to try to make sure we are run from nbdkit:
#
# - $tmpdir is set to a random, empty directory by nbdkit.  Note the
# contents are deleted when nbdkit exits.
#
# - $1 is set (to a method name).
