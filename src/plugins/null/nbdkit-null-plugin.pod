=head1 NAME

nbdkit-null-plugin - nbdkit bitbucket plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit null size=SIZE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-null-plugin> is a null plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.  Everything
written to the virtual device is discarded, and reads back as zeroes.

Most NBD consumers will be very confused by this device.  Trying to
create filesystems etc on it will likely fail badly.  If the client is
caching writes locally then you will get inconsistent read behaviour.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<size=SIZE>

Specify the virtual size of the disk image.

This parameter is required.
