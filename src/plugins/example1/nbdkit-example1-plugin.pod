=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit example1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-example1-plugin> is a minimal L<nbdkit(1)> plugin.

It serves, readonly, from memory, a static blob of data which looks a
little bit like a 100 MB disk image that contains a single empty
partition.

Mainly this is useful for testing nbdkit and as an example for writing
nbdkit plugins (L<nbdkit-plugin(3)>).
