=head1 NAME

nbdkit-tar-plugin - read and write files inside tar files without unpacking

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit tar tar=FILENAME.tar file=PATH_INSIDE_TAR

=head1 EXAMPLE

=head2 Serve a single file inside a tarball

 nbdkit tar tar=file.tar file=some/disk.img
 guestfish --format=raw -a nbd://localhost

=head2 Opening a disk image inside an OVA file

The popular "Open Virtual Appliance" (OVA) format is really an
uncompressed tar file containing (usually) VMDK-format files, so you
could access one file in an OVA like this:

 $ tar tf rhel.ova
 rhel.ovf
 rhel-disk1.vmdk
 rhel.mf
 $ nbdkit -r tar tar=rhel.ova file=rhel-disk1.vmdk
 $ guestfish --ro --format=vmdk -a nbd://localhost

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-tar-plugin> is a plugin which can read and writes files
inside an uncompressed tar file without unpacking the tar file.

The C<tar> and C<file> parameters are required, specifying the name of
the uncompressed tar file and the exact path of the file within the
tar file to access as a disk image.

This plugin will B<not> work on compressed tar files.

Use the nbdkit I<-r> flag to open the file readonly.  This is the
safest option because it guarantees that the tar file will not be
modified.  Without I<-r> writes will modify the tar file.

Also writing to the tar file does not change data checksums stored in
other files (the C<rhel.mf> file in the example above), and as these
will become incorrect you probably won't be able to open the file with
another tool afterwards.

The disk image cannot be resized.
