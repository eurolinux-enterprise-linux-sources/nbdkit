=head1 NAME

nbdkit-example4-plugin - An example nbdkit plugin written in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit example4 size=<N>

=head1 EXAMPLE

 nbdkit example4 size=1048576
 guestfish -a nbd://localhost

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-example4-plugin> is an example L<nbdkit(1)> plugin
written in Perl.

The C<size=N> parameter is required.  It specifies the disk size in
bytes.  A single disk image, initially all zeroes, is created and can
be read and written by all clients.  When nbdkit shuts down the disk
image is thrown away.

Mainly this is useful for testing and as an example of nbdkit plugins
written in Perl.  You should also read L<nbdkit-plugin(3)> and
L<nbdkit-perl-plugin(3)>.  Note that nbdkit plugins may be written in
C or other scripting languages.
