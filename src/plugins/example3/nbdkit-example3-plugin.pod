=head1 NAME

nbdkit-example3-plugin - An example nbdkit plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit example3 [size=SIZE]

=head1 EXAMPLE

 nbdkit example3 size=1G
 guestfish --ro --format=raw -a nbd://localhost

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-example3-plugin> is an example L<nbdkit(1)> plugin.

On each connection, it generates a temporary writable block device of
size C<SIZE>.  The disk is thrown away when the client disconnects.

The C<size=SIZE> parameter can use a number of common formats to
specify the size, eg. C<100M>, C<2G>.  If the parameter is omitted, it
defaults to 100M.

Mainly this is useful for testing nbdkit and as an example for writing
nbdkit plugins (L<nbdkit-plugin(3)>).
