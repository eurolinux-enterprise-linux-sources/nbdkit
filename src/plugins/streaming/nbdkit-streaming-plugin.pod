nbdkit-streaming-plugin - nbdkit streaming plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit streaming pipe=FILENAME [size=SIZE]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-streaming-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> that can turn
certain kinds of input into a stream.

If the NBD client opens the NBD port, and writes from the start to the
end of the disk without seeking backwards, then this plugin will turn
the resulting disk image into a stream of data which is written to the
named C<pipe> parameter.

Typical usage is with qemu tools.  For example:

 qemu-img convert input -O raw output

does I<not> work if C<output> is a pipe.  However this does:

 nbdkit -U /tmp/nbd.sock streaming pipe=output --run '
   qemu-img convert -n input -O raw $nbd
 '

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<pipe=FILENAME>

Write to the named pipe or socket.  If the pipe or socket does not
exist, then it is created (as a named FIFO), otherwise the existing
pipe or socket is opened and used.

This parameter is required.

=item B<size=SIZE>

Specify the virtual size of the stream.

This parameter is optional.  If not specified, then the virtual disk
appears to the client to be very large (effectively infinite).
Whether you need to specify this parameter depends on the client.
Some clients don't check the size and just write/stream, others do
checks or calculations based on the apparent size.
