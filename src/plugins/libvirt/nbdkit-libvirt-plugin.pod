=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<connect=URI>

This optional parameter specifies the libvirt connection URI.

=item B<domain=DOMAIN>

This required parameter specifies the libvirt domain name
(guest name).

=item B<disk=DISK>

This required parameter specifies the guest's disk that we want to
read.

You can either give the path to the backing device (C</path/to/disk>)
or the target name (eg. C<sda>).

In either case use C<virsh dumpxml DOMAIN> to list possible disks.
Look for S<C<E<lt>source dev=...E<gt>>> or
S<C<E<lt>source file=...E<gt>>> or
S<C<E<lt>target dev=...E<gt>>> in the XML.
