=head1 NAME

nbdkit-gzip-plugin - nbdkit gzip plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit gzip [file=]FILENAME.gz

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-gzip-plugin> is a file serving plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.

It serves the named C<FILENAME.gz> over NBD, uncompressing it on the
fly.  The plugin only supports read-only connections.

B<Note> that gzip files are not very good for random access in large
files because seeking to a position in the gzip file involves
uncompressing lots of data.  A more practical method to compress large
disk images is to use the L<xz(1)> format and L<nbdkit-xz-plugin(1)>.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<file=>FILENAME.gz

Serve the compressed file named C<FILENAME.gz>.

This parameter is required.

In nbdkit E<ge> 1.8, C<file=> may be omitted.  To ensure that the
filename does not end up being parsed accidentally as C<key=value>,
prefix relative paths with C<./> (absolute paths do not need
modification).
