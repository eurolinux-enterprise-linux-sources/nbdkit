=head1 NAME

nbdkit-service - running nbdkit as a service, and systemd socket activation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most people start nbdkit from the command line or run it from another
program (see L<nbdkit-captive(1)>.  It is also possible to run nbdkit
as a standalone service, which is what this page describes.

=head1 SOCKET ACTIVATION

nbdkit supports socket activation (sometimes called systemd socket
activation).  This is a simple protocol where instead of nbdkit itself
opening the listening socket(s), the parent process (typically
systemd) passes in pre-opened file descriptors.  Socket activation
lets you serve infrequent NBD requests using a superserver without
needing nbdkit to be running the whole time.

Socket activation is triggered when both the C<LISTEN_FDS> and
C<LISTEN_PID> environment variables are set.  In this mode using
I<-i>, I<-p>, I<--run>, I<-s> or I<-U> flags on the command line is
illegal and will cause an error.  Also in this mode nbdkit does not
fork into the background (ie. I<-f> is implied).

=head2 Using socket activation with systemd

To use nbdkit with socket activation from systemd, create a unit file
ending in C<.socket> (eg. C</etc/systemd/system/nbdkit.socket>)
containing:

 [Unit]
 Description=NBDKit Network Block Device server
 
 [Socket]
 ListenStream=10809
 
 [Install]
 WantedBy=sockets.target

There are various formats for the C<ListenStream> key.  See
L<systemd.socket(5)> for more information.

Also create a service unit (eg. C</etc/systemd/system/nbdkit.service>)
containing:

 [Service]
 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nbdkit file /path/to/serve

For more information on systemd and socket activation, see
L<http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html>

=head1 LOGGING

Error messages from nbdkit can be sent to either standard error
(I<--log=stderr>) or to the system log (I<--log=syslog>).

The default, if I<--log> is not specified on the command line, is to
send error messages to stderr, unless nbdkit forks into the background
in which case they are sent to syslog.

In detail:

=over 4

=item Messages go to standard error (stderr):

When running from the command line in the foreground.

When using systemd socket activation.

Using I<--log=stderr> forces all messages to go to standard error.

=item Messages go to the system log (syslog):

When running from the command line, forked into the background.

Using I<--log=syslog> forces all messages to go to the system log.

=back

Debug messages (I<-v>/I<--verbose>) always go to standard error and
are never sent to the system log.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item C<LISTEN_FDS>

=item C<LISTEN_PID>

If present in the environment when nbdkit starts up, these trigger
